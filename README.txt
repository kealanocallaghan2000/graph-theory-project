---Log of progress---

Feb 7th:
-> Created a repository and a txt file as my first commit for the graph theory project, brushed up on ideas and concepts to date 
to help with understanding how to go about the project. No grasp on how the python will be implemented to 
use automata.

March 31st:
-> Began the project, up until this point I have just been studying the different concepts like the shunting
yard algorithm and thompsons construction and trying to make sense of how they will eventually work in the 
form on nfa's to work through a txt file like a regular expression.
-> I spent the time on my project to figure out the best way to read a file path in python, the reading
was simple but figuring out that I needed to use /mnt to find a path took longer than I care to admit.
-> Only hard coded file path works.

Apr 5th:
-> User can finally input their custom file path and the programme will output each line of the code.

Apr 9th:
-> I spent today implementing the shunting yard algorithm from the lecture into my programme so that instead
of a hard coded regular expression the user can now input any re that they want.
-> Finally starting to understand how the concepts we've learned to date will be applied to the project.
-> File reading and writing code commented out for now.

Apr 15:
-> Applied thompsons construction to the project so now when the user inputs their regular expression,
the project will make a postfix version of it and then turn it into an nfa.
-> Watching videos on the match function to be applied soon.
